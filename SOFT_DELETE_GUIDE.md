## 🔧 Technical Implementation

**Restore Product:**
```bash
PATCH /api/menu/products.php?id={product_id}&action=restore
```

**Get Active Products:**
```bash
GET /api/menu/products.php?is_active=true
```

**Get Deleted Products:**
```bash
GET /api/menu/products.php?is_active=false
```

### **Database Schema:**
```sql
-- Products table already has is_active column
-- is_active = TRUE (1) for active items
-- is_active = FALSE (0) for soft-deleted items
```

### **Frontend Features:**

**Toggle Buttons:**
```html
<!-- Active Items Button -->
<button class="btn btn-outline-success active" onclick="toggleItemStatus('active')">
    <i class="ti ti-eye"></i> Active Items
</button>

<!-- Deleted Items Button -->  
<button class="btn btn-outline-danger" onclick="toggleItemStatus('deleted')">
    <i class="ti ti-trash"></i> Deleted Items
</button>
```

**Action Buttons:**
- **Active View**: Edit + Delete buttons
- **Deleted View**: Restore button only

## 🎨 User Interface

### **Visual Indicators:**
- ✅ **Active Items**: Green "Active" badge, normal styling
- ❌ **Deleted Items**: Red "Inactive" badge, muted styling

- **Restore Confirmation**: "Apakah Anda yakin ingin memulihkan?"

## 🔐 Security Features

### **Data Protection:**

- **Audit Trail**: `updated_at` timestamp tracks when items were deleted/restored

### **Permission Control:**

## 📊 Benefits of Soft Delete

DELETE FROM products 
WHERE is_active = FALSE 
AND updated_at < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR);
```
